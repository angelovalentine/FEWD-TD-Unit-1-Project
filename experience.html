        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I identify most as a creative and would describe myself as versatile, determined, and easy to get along with. In the past I’ve worked for great companies like Apple as a technical specialist, where I worked directly with Apple users within my community to educate them about their devices. Within that time I became acutely aware of how to troubleshoot and diagnose issues, which I learned mostly through my resourceful team. I believe this was the driving force that contributed to longing I felt after leaving the company.</p>
        <p>The past two years I’ve been working as a stage technician for Hard Rock Live. I still remember walking in on day one with only an educational background in live production. Nothing could have prepared me for what was in store. Throughout my time with the company I’ve learned about signal routing, lighting, audio, and video. Thinking back in hindsight I realize this wasn’t at all the career I was looking for. In fact, I’d always felt like I should make use of my degree in music production like others had made use of their degrees within their field. It’s clear in the experience I’ve gained throughout my 20’s that producing creative work like music or photography doesn’t have to be commoditized. It can be enjoyed out of the passion to create relationships and build community.</p>
        <p>As I approach the 5 year mark since I started back at Apple, I find myself at the crossroads of complacency and a rewarding career path. A without having to step back into the field of customer service or retail, I’m doing my best to step into the tech industry and contribute my skills and creative vision to my team and it’s community. </p>
